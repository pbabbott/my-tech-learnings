# Overview

This example demonstrates how to use the built-in VS code tools to run various commands against a Typescript express API.

# Problem Statement

I want to know how to use the VS Code IDE better.  In my explorations in [`basic-node-example`](../basic-node-example/README.md) I did a deep dive on the debugger and how it works with Node.js projects.

While this experience was informative, I am left wondering how a debugger might work with Typescript, source maps, docker, docker-compose, and kubernetes.

I am particularly interested to see how remote debugging might work.

# Getting Started

In order to get started with this example, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md)

`npm init`
`npm i -D typescript`
`npx tsc --init`
