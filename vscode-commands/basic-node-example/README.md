# Overview

This example demonstrate how to use the built-in VS code tools to run various commands against a basic Node.js project.

# Problem statement

I want to know how to use the VS Code IDE better.  I know there are sections on the side-bar for running tests, debugging, and starting / stopping an API.  

While I do love running commands in the terminal, I wonder if using some of the built-in VS code features, perhaps I might be able to work a little more effectively.
